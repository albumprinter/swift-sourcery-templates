# swift-sourcery-templates
Code-generation templates for Swift language.

This repository contains code-generation templates (to be used along with [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) engine) for generating advanced protocol mock classes that can be used as [test doubles](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html) in place of object dependencies for unit-testing.
